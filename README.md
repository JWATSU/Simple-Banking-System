# Simple Banking System
 
This is a project from https://hyperskill.org/. The program simulates basic banking operations such as creating an account, depositing funds, transferring funds to other accounts and deleting the account. Accounts are stored in a SQLite database which is accessed using JDBC. Accounts are created in the form of a bank card: The account number is partially randomly generated with the last digit being generated (and verified in other operations) with the Luhn Algorithm.
